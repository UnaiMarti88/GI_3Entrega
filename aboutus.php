            <h2 class="letterTitle">RevivaTech: Renewable technology, safeguarding the future.</h2>

            <p><strong>RevivaTech</strong> was founded in 2023 with the aim of offering an innovative option in the second-hand computer device market. From the very beginning, our goal has been to extend the life of electronic devices and help reduce waste by promoting recycling and reuse.
                <br><br>

                In collaboration with the Sasieta community, we collect and repair old and unused devices and parts. Our experts meticulously examine each technology piece, performing necessary repairs or utilizing usable parts to recover other devices. Through our web platform, users can sell devices, receive evaluations, and make secure purchases sustainably.

                <br><br>

                Throughout our history, our commitment to innovation and responsibility towards the environment has guided us, and we will continue to offer sustainable and accessible technology in the future.
